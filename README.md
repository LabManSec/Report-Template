# Red Team Reporting Template
Based on the template by redteam.guides, found [here](https://redteam.guide/docs/Templates/report_template/)


## Overview
This reporting template serves as more of a structure-focused template as opposed to a content-focused template. 
That is, it's moreso meant to ensure your report is formatted cleanly as opposed to giving you guidance on what to enter within your report.
I recommend referencing the report template linked above or searching for other templates for content references.
Whether you've worked with LaTeX before or not, the formatting should be relatively intuitive based on what has been put there as an example.


### Inserting images
Since I initially generated this template using the Pandoc plugin in Obsidian, inserting images won't be the same for you as it was for me.
I recommend using the first method outlined [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images), which uses the `graphicx` package in LaTeX.
I personally wasn't a fan of how LaTeX formats pictures, so I just added `\emph{INSERT_CAPTION_HERE}` below each image.
